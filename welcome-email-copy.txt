Once you've gone ahead and done that, here are three things you can do next:

1) Share Poly with your friends and teachers. If you like using Poly so far, please invite and encourage those around you to join in. We're a tight-knit community, and everyone has something to add, whether it be feedback to the app, new partnerships with schools or projects, or new word lists.

2) Head over to [www.wikitongues.org](#) and learn about what the Wikitongues organization does beyond Poly. [Discover the languages of the world](#) on our video archive on Youtube! Excited yet? Help us record new languages and fulfill our mission of working with every language in the world!

3) Be sure to stay in the know! Subscribe to monthly publishing guides on Patreon, watch our content on Youtube, discover new and incredible points of view and the science behind them on our Medium blog, and keep in touch by liking our Facebook page, following us on twitter, and subscribing to our mailing list. There's never enough culture.

P.S. We won't send you any more Wikitongues emails unless you subscribe to our mailing list.

Thanks,

Team Poly
